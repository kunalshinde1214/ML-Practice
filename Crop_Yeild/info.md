# 🌾 Crop Yield Analysis and Prediction

This project aims to analyze and predict crop yields using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. It covers the relationship between crop yield and features such as region, rainfall, and time using multiple regression algorithms.

## 📊 Features of the Notebook

- ✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing
- 🌍 Top 10 regions with highest average crop yield
- 📈 Trend analysis of crop yield over the years (early vs recent)
- 🌧️ Rainfall vs Yield correlation analysis
- 🤖 Machine Learning models to predict crop yield:
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - LightGBM Regressor
- 📉 Performance evaluation using:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R-squared (R²)
- 📊 Visual comparison of Actual vs Predicted values

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models

### 1. 🌲 Random Forest Regressor
- Ensemble-based model
- Handles high-dimensional data
- ✅ R²: ~0.97

### 2. 👨‍👧‍👦 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor
- Instance-based learning
- Good for simple baseline comparison

### 3. 🌿 Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Boosting-based ensemble model
- Captures complex patterns

### 4. ⚡ LightGBM Regressor (LGB)
- Fast, efficient gradient boosting framework by Microsoft
- Excellent for large datasets
- Often outperforms traditional boosting algorithms
